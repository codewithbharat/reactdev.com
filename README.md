### **Project Name: AI Blog Generator**

### **Objective:**
A platform that automatically generates niche-specific blogs every hour using OpenAI, ensuring the content is unique, optimized for SEO, and published without plagiarism. The blog topics will evolve based on the content previously generated, and the platform will keep updating content dynamically.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic Blog Generation:**
   - AI (OpenAI GPT) will automatically generate a blog post every hour.
   - The AI will choose new blog topics based on the five most recent blog titles to maintain continuity.
   
2. **Topic Selection and Update:**
   - Predefined niche-based topics will evolve with the latest blog content.
   - You can manually update or add new topics to keep the content fresh.

3. **Plagiarism Checking:**
   - After content is generated, it will be checked for plagiarism using a third-party API (like Copyscape or Quetext).
   - If plagiarism is detected, the content is either rewritten or a source is credited.

4. **SEO Optimization:**
   - Each blog will be optimized for SEO with meta tags, headers, keywords, and a clean, readable structure.
   - Use of tools like **Yoast SEO** (or similar) to enhance visibility on search engines.

5. **Automatic Publishing:**
   - After ensuring plagiarism-free content, the blog is automatically posted on the website.
   - The content will be added to a blog feed and displayed with options like "Read More" for detailed posts.

6. **Admin Panel:**
   - A simple dashboard where you can monitor the generated blogs, edit or delete them, and update the niche topics.
   - You can manually trigger the blog generation process if needed.

7. **User Engagement:**
   - Allow users to comment or like posts.
   - Social media share buttons on each blog post.

8. **Notification System:**
   - Email notifications for subscribers when a new blog post is published.
   - A push notification system (if desired) to alert users of new posts.

9. **Content Archive:**
   - An archive page where users can browse previous blog posts, categorized by topic.
   - Users can filter blogs based on date, most liked, or other criteria.
